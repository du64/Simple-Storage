# Simple Storage
Storage is an extrmely fast program to store files on a webserver.

## Get Started
Simply clone the repository into whatever public server directory you want, and then point your (sub)domain to the directory where you placed the files.
Go to that domain in the browser, and you have access to upload, download, and delete files in that directory.

## Integrating with Retriever
You can integrate Storage with the Retriever search engine to search through your files. Storage is based on file metadata, and does not need a database.

## Can I view all files on the server?
Fear not, you can't view and edit everything, it is limited to a pre-generated folder called `files`.
